# Hierarchy Panel Improvements Summary

## Completed Improvements

### 1. ✅ Made UI Values Configurable
- Replaced hardcoded button sizes (20px, 30px) with configurable member variables
- Made double-click time configurable (was 0.3f)
- Made drop zone threshold configurable (was 30%)
- Made default entity position and sprite size configurable
- All UI constants are now member variables that can be adjusted

### 2. ✅ Replaced ASCII Icons with FontAwesome
- Replaced ASCII icons like [*], [O], [P] with proper FontAwesome icons
- Entity icons now use: \uf0eb (lightbulb), \uf030 (camera), \uf007 (user), etc.
- Visibility buttons use: \uf06e (eye) / \uf070 (eye-slash)
- Lock buttons use: \uf023 (lock) / \uf09c (unlock)
- Added proper tooltips for all buttons

### 3. ✅ Implemented Full Undo/Redo System
- Added support for Create operations
- Added support for Delete operations (with entity list tracking)
- Added support for Reparent operations
- Rename operations were already implemented
- All operations now properly record for undo/redo

### 4. ✅ Added Performance Optimizations
- Implemented caching system for:
  - Display names (m_cachedDisplayNames)
  - Entity icons (m_cachedIcons)
  - Children lists (m_childrenCache)
  - Root entities (m_cachedRootEntities)
- Added dirty flagging to avoid unnecessary updates
- Only rebuilds hierarchy when entity count changes
- UpdateCaches() method manages all cache invalidation

### 5. ✅ Completed All TODO Entity Creation
- Implemented CreateDirectionalLightEntity()
- Implemented CreateSpotLightEntity()
- Implemented CreateAreaLightEntity()
- Implemented CreateParticleSystemEntity()
- Implemented CreateTrailRendererEntity()
- Implemented CreatePointLightChild() for context menu
- All create operations now record for undo/redo

### 6. ✅ Fixed Event System Type Safety
- Moved FocusCameraEvent from local definition to Events.h
- Added proper includes for Vector3
- Event is now properly typed and can be used by other systems
- Fixed event cleanup and subscription management

### 7. ✅ Implemented Select Children Feature
- Added SelectChildren() method
- Recursively selects all children and grandchildren
- Maintains parent in selection
- Updates primary selection appropriately
- Connected to context menu

### 8. ✅ Removed 3D Menu Items
- Removed "3D Object" submenu from create button popup
- Removed "3D Object" submenu from right-click context menu
- Removed individual 3D object items (Cube, Sphere, Plane, Cylinder)
- Kept 2D objects, lights, effects, and physics items

## Code Quality Improvements

- Added proper cache invalidation on entity modifications
- Improved memory management with better cache cleanup
- Reduced string allocations in render loop
- Added functional header for std::function usage
- Improved tooltips for better user experience

## Remaining Minor Issues (Low Priority)

1. Material ID generation still uses simple hash (collision risk)
2. No hierarchy connection lines between parent/child
3. No entity sorting options
4. No prefab support
5. Area lights fall back to point lights (renderer limitation)

## Performance Impact

The caching system significantly reduces CPU usage by:
- Avoiding string creation every frame
- Caching entity relationships
- Only updating when hierarchy changes
- Pre-computing root entity order

The hierarchy panel should now be much more responsive, especially with large entity counts.
